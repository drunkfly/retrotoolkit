.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH NAME
raw2hdf \(em Create an .hdf hard disk image from a raw data file
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B raw2hdf
.RI [ OPTION ]
.I rawfile hdffile
.P
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
raw2hdf converts a binary dump of a hard disk's data into an IDE disk
image in .hdf format for use with Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulators.
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RI "\-v "version
specifies the version of .hdf image to be created. Valid values are
.RI ` 1.0 '
for a version 1.0 file and
.RI ` 1.1 '
for a version 1.1 file. Defaults to creating version 1.1 files.
.TP
.TP
.IR \-h ", " \-\-help
give brief usage help, listing available options.
.TP
.IR \-V ", " \-\-version
output version information.
.I rawfile
specifies a raw data file (or block device corresponding to an actual
disk) to be converted.
.TP
.I hdffile
specifies the .hdf file to create.
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH NOTES
Since raw2hdf has no knowledge of the geometry of the disk from which
the original image was taken (indeed, the input file need not
originate from a real IDE disk at all), there is no guarantee that
the information contained in the .hdf file header accurately
represents the original disk. However, it will attempt to construct a
header that is consistent with the size of the image, to produce
an .hdf file which is functionally equivalent.
