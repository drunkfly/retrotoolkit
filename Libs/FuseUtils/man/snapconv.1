.SH NAME
snapconv \(em Sinclair ZX Spectrum snapshot converter
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snapconv
[ \-c ] [ \-n ] [ \-f ]
.I infile outfile
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
snapconv converts between ZX Spectrum snapshot files.
.\"
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-c
specifies that all data in the output snapshot should be compressed,
even if that compression will result in a bigger file than if some
data is left uncompressed. This helps compatibility with some buggy
programs that can only read entirely compressed .z80 files.
.TP
.I \-n
specifies that the output snapshot should be uncompressed.
.TP
.I \-f
specifies that the A and F and A\(aq and F\(aq registers should be swapped.
Version 0.5.0 and older of 
.IR libspectrum "(3)"
had a bug that resulted in these registers being swapped in SZX 
snapshots only. Version 0.5.1 and newer of
.IR libspectrum "(3)"
automatically recognise these snapshots and correct the problem, but
this flag is necessary to fix some snapshots created by
.I development versions only
of
.IR libspectrum "(3)"
which had the bug fixed, but cannot be distinguished from snapshots
containing the bug.
.TP
.IR \-h ", " \-\-help
give brief usage help, listing available options.
.TP
.IR \-V ", " \-\-version
output version information.
.TP
.I infile
specifies the snapshot to be converted. This file can be in any of the
snapshot formats supported by
.IR libspectrum "(3)."
.TP
.I outfile
specifies the output snapshot. The format will be determined by the
file extension and can be in any of the formats
.IR libspectrum "(3)"
supports for output.
